## Additions (author: Daniel van Niekerk):

This is a fork of the above with derivations and additions for
application in TTS. Specifically, the above resources (DCG grammar and
labelled corpus) is simplified to parse Zulu words into lexical items
belonging to two categories: ["content"][1] or ["function"][2],
i.e. [open-class or closed-class][3] lexical items.
